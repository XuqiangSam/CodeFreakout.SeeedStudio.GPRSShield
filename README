CodeFreakout.SeeedStudio.GPRSShield

Driver for the GPRS Shield designed by Seeed Studio (http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/gprs-shield-p-779.html?cPath=132_134).  Provides basic HTTP POST and SMS support.  Built around the Netduino platform but could be adapted to other .NET Micro based development boards.  Requires .NET Micro 4.2.

A Nuget package is available in the Nuget gallery if you just want to use the driver.

Example Code:
var gsm = new GPRSShield("apn.somewirelesscompany.com", SerialPorts.COM1);
gsm.Post("baseurl.com", 80, "/somePathOnThatUrl", "application/json","{\"Key\":\"Value\"}");

NOTE:
When adding a reference to the project when using the nuget package it seems that Nuget is choosing the wrong dll to reference.  Please manually remove the reference and add a reference to the dll located in the netmf42 folder.
